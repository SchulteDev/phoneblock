			<h1 data-tx="t0001">Privacy policy</h1>

			<h2 data-tx="t0002">IP address</h2>
			<p data-tx="t0003">When you visit this site, your computer's IP address is temporarily stored in a log file for error analysis purposes and automatically deleted after 14 days. Without registration, this site does not collect any personal data from its visitors and contains neither advertising nor third-party trackers.</p>

			<h2 data-tx="t0004">e-mail</h2>
			<p data-tx="t0005">When you register for a PhoneBlock account, the e-mail address you provide will be stored for the purpose of user authentication. The e-mail address will not be passed on to third parties. E-mails will only be sent to the specified address for authentication or for the operation of PhoneBlock.</p>

			<h2 data-tx="t0006">Cookies</h2>
			<p data-tx="t0007">A technically necessary session cookie is set during some interactions with the PhoneBlock website, e.g. during registration and the evaluation of telephone numbers.</p>
			<p data-tx="t0008">If you activate the "Keep me logged in on this device" function when logging in, PhoneBlock will set a persistent cookie with which the site will recognize you on your next visit, so that you are automatically logged in without having to re-enter your password or repeat the Google login process. If you click the "Log out" button, this cookie will be deleted and you will have to log in again on your next visit.</p>

			<h2 data-tx="t0009">Account deletion</h2>
			<p data-tx="t0010">You can delete your PhoneBlock account at any time in the <a th:href="@{/settings/}">settings</a>. By deleting your account, your data stored with PhoneBlock will be deleted.</p>
			
			<h2 data-tx="t0011">Telephone numbers</h2>
			<p data-tx="t0012">If your phone number has been added to the blocklist by mistake, you can of course request that it be deleted. Write an e-mail to <code>Bernhard Haumacher <button class="button is-small is-link is-light showaddr">...</button></code>.</p>

			<h2 data-tx="t0013">Answering machine</h2>
			<p data-tx="t0014">When using the <a th:href="@{/anrufbeantworter/}">PhoneBlock answering machine</a>, PhoneBlock must permanently save the IP address of your Fritz!Box in order to register the answering machine there and maintain the registration. To do this, you have either stored the host name of your Fritz!Box or installed the DynDNS service from PhoneBlock in your Fritz!Box</p>
			
			<p data-tx="t0015">Incoming calls to your Fritz!Box are displayed to a registered answering machine. The phone number of the caller is transmitted to the PhoneBlock answering machine. This telephone number is used to compare it with the SPAM telephone number database. Only if the telephone number is contained in the SPAM database will the answering machine accept the call and save the call in your answering machine's call list. In all other cases, no data about the call will be stored in PhoneBlock.</p>
