# PhoneBlock
The Spam-Filter for your phone

## How does PhoneBlock work?

PhoneBlock is a phone list maintained by the PhoneBlock community with phone numbers of spam callers. This phone list is set up in your Internet router "FRITZ!Box" as a block list. As soon as a number is added to this block list, your FRITZ!Box will automatically reject callers with this number. The telephone remains mute.

If you still receive an unwanted call because the number is not yet in the blocking list, you can easily add the number to the blocking list in your FRITZ!Box. As soon as you have done this, your FrizBox will update the blocking list for all members of the PhoneBlock community and calls from this new number will be rejected by all others immediately.

## What are the requirements?

PhoneBlock works on a "landline" in combination with a "FRITZ!Box" internet router from AVM. It doesn't have to be the latest model, but you should check if the latest FRITZ!OS is installed on it (07.29 or newer). If this is not the case, check the installation guide to see if your version already offers the necessary options.

The only other thing you need is a PhoneBlock account, with which you can set up the phone block list in your FRITZ!Box.
