t0001=Installation as answering machine
t0002=PhoneBlock offers you an intelligent answering machine that automatically only answers the call if the caller's number is listed in PhoneBlock's <x1>SPAM database</x1>. Just like for the <x2>setup of the blocklist</x2>, you do not need your own device or computer for this. You create a PhoneBlock answering machine here on the website and register it via the Internet on your Fritz!Box or another VOIP-capable Internet router. You can find out exactly how the PhoneBlock answering machine works <x3>here</x3>.
t0003=The following steps will take you to your PhoneBlock answering machine:
t0004=Register with PhoneBlock
t0005=Create answering machine
t0006=Set up DynDNS in the Fritz!Box
t0007=Setting up the telephony device in the Fritz!
t0008=Switching on the PhoneBlock answering machine
t0009=Test answering machine
t0010=The instructions will guide you step by step through the setup. The configuration in the Fritz!Box is not easy, but if you follow the procedure described here exactly, nothing can go wrong.
t0011=Step 1: Register with PhoneBlock
t0012=From here on, you will need three browser windows (or tabs). One for this guide, one for the PhoneBlock answering machine app and one for the configuration interface of your Fritz!
t0013=First you need to register or log in to PhoneBlock to start the setup.
t0014=Log in
t0015=You are logged in as <x1></x1>, great, let's move on to the next step!
t0016=Step 2: Create answering machine
t0017=Clicking here opens a window with the <x1>PhoneBlock answering machine app</x1>. When you open it for the first time, the list of your answering machines is empty and there is a button at the bottom right with which you can create an answering machine. Press this plus button.
t0018=Open app
t0019=Step 4: Set up DynDNS
t0020=Your Fritz! box tells PhoneBlock its IP address via "DynDNS". This is necessary so that the PhoneBlock answering machine can find your Fritz!
t0021=Activate PhoneBlock DynDNS
t0022=Activate the "Use PhoneBlock DynDNS" switch in the <x1>answering machine app</x1> (if you know your way around and are already using a different DynDNS provider, you can also enter the host name of your Fritz!)
t0023=On the next page, confirm with "Activate DynDNS".
t0024=You will now receive access data for the PhoneBlock DynDNS, which you can enter in your Fritz!Box (see below).
t0025=Enter login data in the Fritz!Box
t0026=This link <x1>opens a window for your Fritz!Box</x1>. Log in there with your Fritz!Box password. If you have never done this before, you will find the password on the bottom of the Fritz!
t0027=In your <x1>Fritz!Box</x1>, navigate to "Internet > Shares" in the sidebar and select the "DynDNS" tab.
t0028=Open Fritz!Box
t0029=Copy the data for "Update-Url", "Domain name", "User name" and "Password" from the <x1>answering machine app</x1> and enter them in your <x2>Fritz!Box</x2>. And confirm with "Apply" (point 5 in the image below).
t0030=Check DynDNS
t0031=Now go back to the <x1>answering machine app</x1> and check the settings (point 6 in the picture above). If PhoneBlock has found your Fritz!Box, you will be taken to the next page with the access data for the actual answering machine.
t0032=Step 4: Setting up the answering machine in the Fritz!
t0033=The answering machine is now set up as a telephony device in the Fritz! To do this, open your <x1>Fritz!Box interface</x1> again.
t0034=Setting up the telephony device
t0035=Navigate to "Telephony > Telephony devices" in the sidebar and click the "Set up new device" button.
t0036=Select the type of device
t0037=Select the option "Telephone (with and without answering machine)" and click on "Next". Note: Do <x1>not</x1> select the obvious option "Answering machine", as this can only be used to configure answering machines that are permanently installed in the Fritz!
t0038=Configuring the IP telephone
t0039=On the "Connect phone" page, select the "LAN/WLAN (IP phone)" option and give the new device the name "PhoneBlock" in the text field below. Then click on "Next".
t0040=Transfer access data
t0041=On the next page "Apply settings in IP phone" you will be asked for "User name" and "Password". Copy the corresponding data here that is displayed in the <x1>answering machine app</x1 Click on "Next".
t0042=Settings for outgoing calls
t0043=On the page "Set up phone for outgoing calls" you can simply click "Next". The PhoneBlock answering machine does not need a phone number for outgoing calls because it never actively makes calls. We will deactivate this number in a later step so that your answering machine really cannot make any calls.
t0044=Select numbers to be protected
t0045=On the "Set up phone settings for incoming calls" page, you should leave the default setting "Accept all calls". If you only want to protect certain numbers from SPAM calls, you can also select the numbers for which the answering machine will see a call at all. Click on "Next".
t0046=Confirm configuration
t0047=You will now be taken to the "Apply settings" summary page. You can check the settings you have made again and confirm them with "Apply".
t0048=Finish configuring the device
t0049=You are back in the "Device overview". You should now see your new answering machine "PhoneBlock" in the list. However, before you can switch on the answering machine, you need to make further settings. To do this, click on the edit pencil at the end of the PhoneBlock line.
t0050=Stop outgoing calls
t0051=In the "Outgoing calls" selection field, you can now select the last empty entry to ensure that your answering machine cannot make calls on its own. Do <x1>not</x1> click on the Apply button at the bottom, but on the second tab "Login data". You will now be asked whether you want to save the changes. Click on "Apply" in this dialog.
t0052=Allow login from the Internet
t0053=In the "Login data" tab, you must now activate the "Allow login from the Internet" option and copy the password from the <x1>answering machine app</x1> again and enter it in the "Password" field. Only then click on the "Apply" button.
t0054=Step 5: Switching on the answering machine
t0055=The configuration of your answering machine is now complete. Switch back to the <x1>answering machine app</x1> and switch on your new answering machine.
t0056=Congratulations, if everything went well, the answering machine in the <x1>answering machine app</x1> should now be displayed in green as "switched on". The next unpleasant callers can discuss with PhoneBlock in the future.
t0057=Step 6: Test the answering machine
t0058=If you want to try out how a call with the not quite everyday PhoneBlock answering machine works, you can call it from a telephone connected directly to the Fritz!Box (e.g. a DECT cordless telephone) via the <x1>internal number</x1> of the answering machine. The answering machine always accepts such test calls. <x2>Important:</x2> This works <x3>only</x3> via the answering machine's internal number (usually starts with "**"). You can find the internal number in the device overview of your Fritz!Box in the "PhoneBlock" line. Why don't you try to estimate a photovoltaic system for him? Have fun!
