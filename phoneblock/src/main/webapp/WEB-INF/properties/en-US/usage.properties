t0003=Disclaimer
t0004=The use of PhoneBlock is exclusively and expressly at your own risk. When using PhoneBlock, you are aware that an error in the software or possibly malicious insertion of numbers in the block list could block a number from which you may want to be called.
t0005=Commercial use
t0006=I advise against using PhoneBlock on a business telephone connection. If you want to do this anyway, then you bear the sole risk for any damage that may result. To minimize the risk of use, I recommend that you do not block numbers on the block list, but only redirect them to your answering machine. I also strongly advise against using the PhoneBlock answering machine in a commercial environment - under no circumstances do you want to risk having a potential customer on your telephone line "fooled" by the answering machine.
