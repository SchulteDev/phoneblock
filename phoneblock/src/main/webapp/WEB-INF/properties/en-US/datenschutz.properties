t0014=When using the <x1>PhoneBlock answering machine</x1>, PhoneBlock must permanently save the IP address of your Fritz!Box in order to register the answering machine there and maintain the registration. To do this, you have either stored the host name of your Fritz!Box or installed the DynDNS service from PhoneBlock in your Fritz!Box
t0015=Incoming calls to your Fritz!Box are displayed to a registered answering machine. The phone number of the caller is transmitted to the PhoneBlock answering machine. This telephone number is used to compare it with the SPAM telephone number database. Only if the telephone number is contained in the SPAM database will the answering machine accept the call and save the call in your answering machine's call list. In all other cases, no data about the call will be stored in PhoneBlock.
