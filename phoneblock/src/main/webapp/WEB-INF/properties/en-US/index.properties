t0001=Automatically reject unwanted callers
t0002=Has your phone number also fallen into the hands of dubious address dealers and you are constantly receiving annoying calls that want to "optimize" your electricity bill, give you advice on a solar system, announce another grand prize or offer other "perks"? Then <x1>PhoneBlock</x1> is exactly what you need!

t0007=How does PhoneBlock work?
t0008=PhoneBlock is a list maintained by the PhoneBlock community of telephone numbers that are suspected of being spam. The <x1>PhoneBlock answering machine</x1> then accepts calls from callers on the block list so that your phone remains silent for these calls.
t0009=Alternatively, you can also import the blacklist as a phone book into your "FRITZ!Box" Internet router and block calls from numbers in this <x1>special phone book</x1>. You no longer have to manually block number ranges, because your Fritz!Box automatically updates the blocked list every night. As soon as a number is added to this blacklist, your FRITZ!Box automatically rejects callers with this number. However, the <x2>answering machine</x2> is the better solution because a phone book is limited in size and cannot hold all the numbers in the block list.
t0010=If you still receive an unwanted call because the number has not yet been added to the blocked list, you can easily block the <x1>number in your FRITZ! To do this, make an entry for the unwanted caller in the PhoneBlock address book directly in your Fritz!Box As soon as you have done this, your FrizBox will update the blocking list for all members of the PhoneBlock community and calls from this new number will also be blocked immediately for all others. This is a little more time-consuming than blocking the number in your Fritz!BoxPhone directly, but has the advantage that you protect the entire PhoneBlock community from <x2>further spam calls</x2>.
t0011=What are the requirements?
t0012=PhoneBlock can block unwanted calls either on the <x1>"landline"</x1> in conjunction with a <x2>"FRITZ!Box" Internet router from AVM</x2>, or display directly on your <x3>mobile phone</x3> whether a caller is potentially unwanted.
t0013=Search Fritz!Box
t0014=Not sure if you have a Fritz!Box box? If you are at home in the WLan, then press the search button above. PhoneBlock will then try to find a Fritz!Box box in your area.
