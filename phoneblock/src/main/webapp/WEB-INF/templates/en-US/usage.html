		<p data-tx="t0002">PhoneBlock can help you with your digital self-defense against telephone terror and unwanted advertising calls. PhoneBlock is <a th:href="@{/impressum.jsp}">my</a> private <a href="https://github.com/haumacher/phoneblock">project</a> and I am happy to let you participate in it free of charge.</p>
		
		<h2 data-tx="t0003">Disclaimer</h2>
		
		<p data-tx="t0004">The use of PhoneBlock is exclusively and expressly at your own risk. When using PhoneBlock, you are aware that an error in the software or possibly malicious insertion of numbers in the block list could block a number from which you may want to be called.</p>
		
		<h2 data-tx="t0005">Commercial use</h2>
		
		<p data-tx="t0006">I advise against using PhoneBlock on a business telephone connection. If you want to do this anyway, then you bear the sole risk for any damage that may result. To minimize the risk of use, I recommend that you do not block numbers on the block list, but only redirect them to your answering machine. I also strongly advise against using the PhoneBlock answering machine in a commercial environment - under no circumstances do you want to risk having a potential customer on your telephone line "fooled" by the answering machine.</p>
		
		<h2 data-tx="t0007">Operation of the PhoneBlock server</h2>
		
		<p data-tx="t0008">PhoneBlock is available to you free of charge. However, the operation of a web application is not free of charge. If PhoneBlock helps you, you are welcome to contribute to the operating costs in the form of a <a th:href="@{/support.jsp}">small donation</a>. However, you do this without expecting anything in return.</p>
